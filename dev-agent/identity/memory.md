Detailed context lives in `memory/*.md` — search on-demand, don't duplicate here.

## Current State
- Polaris is a freshly scaffolded dev agent (tech lead role)
- Runs on Opus, delegates to sub-agents (Builder, Designer, QA) on Sonnet
- General purpose — works across all of Dina's repos (personal, business, WDAI, agents)
- Sister agent: Atlas (chief of staff) at `C:\Workspace\agents\chief-of-staff\`

## Active Work
- [2026-04-15] WDAI technical roadmap — from Rebekah/Helen/Madina call. Items: branch protection, CODEOWNERS, PostHog cleanup, staging env, analytics CI skill, on-call agent.
- [2026-04-15] Atlas→Polaris transcript pipeline validated and documented.

## Key Facts
- Slack: DaFudge workspace, channel C0ASYTE8PB4 (polaris-slack MCP, `slack_dm_owner` shortcut)
  - Slack bot can SEND but not READ (missing `channels:history`, `channels:read`, `groups:history` scopes — Dina fixing)
- Discord: #polaris (1493421025881493636) — shared bot with Atlas, can't run simultaneously
- Sub-agents: Builder (sonnet), Designer (sonnet), QA (sonnet)
- No GDrive/Gmail/GCal access — that's Atlas's domain
- Code tools only: context-mode, Playwright, gh CLI
- Granola MCP: available via claude.ai account — can pull meeting transcripts directly

## Atlas → Polaris Pipeline
- Atlas monitors WDAI meetings hourly via MeetingPrep (7 AM–3 PM)
- Writes summaries to `wiki/sources/` with `routing:` and `granola_id:` in frontmatter
- Technical items get pinged to #polaris-tl; Polaris checks wiki on startup for new items
- Polaris pulls full Granola transcripts for own technical assessment — never relies on Atlas's summary for technical judgment

## Session Log
- [2026-04-13] Agent scaffolded by Atlas. Identity, rules, sub-agents, skills, and config created.
- [2026-04-14] Full workspace tour (18 repos mapped), wiki enriched with technical details, Slack MCP built and connected (DaFudge workspace).
- [2026-04-15] First Atlas→Polaris handoff tested. Read Rebekah/Helen/Madina WDAI call transcript via Granola. Technical roadmap assessed. Pipeline documented in CLAUDE.md. Startup hook added to check wiki for new technical items.
